# church-directory
Super quick and simple church directory program.

This is not intended to impress anyone.  These technologies were selected simply for expediency.  I wanted the path of least resistance to create a little app for my lovely wife to use when creating and maintaining a picture directory for our church.  This is not intended to be multi-tenant or distributed pretty much in any way.  Rather, I just want to get better at putting little apps like this into repos.

I'm using WinForms _(Yuck!)_ and... wait for it... an MS Access database _(Gasp!)_.  Again... expediency!  I wanted to take advantage of some of the built-in features of MS Word for doing booklet formatting and pagination so I'm using InteropServices to automate MS Office.

If time permits, I may rebuild this using other technologies, but for now, I'm just knocking this out really quickly.  Don't judge me!  :)
